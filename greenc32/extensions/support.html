  <h2>3. Extension Background</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>All hData section documents identified by an XML namespace must be declared in the extensions node of the root document. Extensions are either &quot;mandatory&quot; or &quot;optional.&quot; Each section document has an address expressed as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Each URI is registered in the extensions node of the root document. Sections can contain either single data type documents (e.g., XML, JSON, HTML) or URIs referencing other sections. Section document content must be expressed in XML and document types must be declared in the extensions node of the root document.</p>
